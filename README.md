Codecademy Capstone Project

This is my capstone project for the Codecademy Ready 'Freelance Website Development' cohort.  It is the first "web site" I have written from scratch, although you can't really call it a site as there is only one page and the links go nowhere.  It was an exercise for practicing html and css using flexbox, responsive design and transitions.  I stuck mostly to the wireframes/mock-ups but added my own color scheme and transitions.  Some things could be accomplished in multiple ways and you may see that I used different ways of doing the same things throughout the code.  Don't hold it against me too much.  I did my best to remove inefficient and redundant code but I'm sure it could be greatly improved.

Please feel free to contact me with questions/comments/suggestions/criticisms.  I appreciate any and all feedback.  Thanks.
